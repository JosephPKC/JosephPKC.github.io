                    <h3>Setting up a Game</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start a game in<span class="project-name"></span>, you must create a game, and decide on the game settings. You must decide how many lives each player gets (1 - 10), how many players (2 - 4), and how much time (5 min max). Each player will then have that many lives at the start, and the game will end when the time is reached.</p>
                    
                    <div class="img-wrapper fade-img">
                        <img id="i4" src="../assets/images/unfeel-tournament/unfeel-tournament-i4.png">
                        <p class="caption">Choosing the game settings.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the game settings are chosen, each player takes turns choosing an emotion. Each emotion can only be chosen once. Difference in emotions have no impact on gameplay, and are purely cosmetic.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the characters are chosen, the level must be chosen. The game comes with 4 different levels: <span>Mountain</span>, <span>Graveyard</span>, <span>Snow</span>, <span>Space</span>. After that, the game begins.</p>

                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the game, each player must move around, dodging each other's attacks, and picking up weapons and items. There are spawn points around the level, in which specific weapons can spawn in. Weapons and items have different spawn rates  depending on the spawn point and the level. When a player picks up a weapon, he/she replaces their previously equipped weapon. If a player picks up an item, the item is consumed immediately and used. </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a player is hit with a weapon, they take damage. When they lose all of their health, they are killed and then respawned. This costs them a life. If a player loses all of their lives, they are out of the game. The last player standing wins, unless the game timer ends before that happens. If the game timer ends, the player with the most kills is determined to be the victor. There are also cases where nobody wins. This is when there is a tie.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Weapons and Items</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different weapons and items:</p>
                    
                    <div class="multi-list">

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the game is over, the players enter a results screen. Here, they can see each player's stats, including kills, deaths, damage dealt, and damage taken. Afterwards, the players are given the ending of the emotion that won, or the ending where no emotions win.</p>

                    <h3>Controls</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the main menu, you can see the controls for various players. To support 4 player local multiplayer, we provided XBox 360 controller support. Two players would use the keyboard + mouse, and the two others would use controllers.</p>

                    <h2 id="dev">Development</h2>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> was made in C# and <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>. The art, textures, sfx, and music were from <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://opengameart.org/">opengameart.org</a> and <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://freesound.org/">freesound.org</a></p>
                    
                    <h3>Characters</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characters consist of a single controller script, the texture, and the animations. The controller allows players to move, jump, pick up weapons, use weapons, take damage, and die. It also controls when certain animations and sounds would go off, and also handles flipping of the textures when needed.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Weapons and Items</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapons and items each have their own scripts. They have a single controller script, and a texture. The controller allows the firing of the weapon, or consumption of the item, and plays sounds when needed. The weapon controllers also instantiate the bubbles when fired. The bubbles themselves have a controller of their own, which handles its movement and trajectory.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Levels</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levels were created using assets from opengameart.org. Each level comprises of platforms, and the never-ending bottom that kills you if you fall. There are several spawn points for items and players all over the level.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Game Manager</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a single game manager that handles the logic of the game. The game manager interacts with the user interface to get values for the game, changes the scenes, loads levels, keeps track of the players and their lives, and determines the winner.</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Interface</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user interface consists of 2 to 4 picture frames for each player, their health, and their lives. There is also a timer that counts down at the top center.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Documentation</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the game, we had to create a <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="../assets/files/unfeel-tournament-design-document.pdf">design document</a> for the course.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is a completed game. However, there are many improvements to be made. This includes a larger variety of weapons and items, more levels, dynamic obstacles in levels, and more customizable game settings. All in all, the core game is complete and functional; it just needs a bit more variety.</p>
