                    <h1>What is Quick Charades?</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick Charades is a small game for Android, where you pit yourself against a friend or random challenger to see who can guess what the pictures are the fastest. This game was made for a java course at PCC (CS 3B).</p>

                    <h1>Development</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick Charades was thought up by Josue Segura when he wanted to make a small, but fun mobile game. Since this was for a java course, we decided to make it for Android. Quick Charades was made in Java, and developed in <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html">Android Studio</a>. We also used <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a> to help test out builds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first few weeks were spent working on the design. We thought up ideas and features, and created a design document. <a href="../assets/quick-charades-design-document.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is the design document, if you want to check it out.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game itself is fairly simple: You are given a series of random images, and you must try to guess what the image is within a time limit. The images are random, but grouped by category. The idea was that you would match up with an opponent, and both players would decide on a category. Once the category is chosen, a series of 10 images (depending on the game settings) would be chosen at random. These images would be obscured in some way, and would slowly reveal themselves. Along with the images were a series of random letters, a subset of which spelled out the answer. You would choose the correct letters in order. You can choose to skip an image, if you cannot figure it out so that you can save time. Once the timer runs out, or once someone finishes, the game ends. Both players are scored on their performance, and the player with the higher score wins.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course much of that didn't happen. We were slowly running out of time, as we spent a lot of it designing, planning, and learning how to make an Android game. We ended up creating a prototype, with a small set of images. You simply only played against the clock, and not versus another player.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major feature we were planning on adding was the leaderboard and friends. You were to be able to add friends, and challenge them directly. You were to also be able to check out global and local leaderboards to see how you rank.</p>

                    <p class="caption">How we planned the in-game UI too look like. You can see the image in the center, the timer at the very top. You can also see the streak counter, and the current score. On the bottom half, you can see icons pertaining to power-ups and the letters you chose from.</p>

                    <p class="caption">The main menu as planned. There would be a tutorial button to give an overview of how the game works. There would also be leaderboards and friends.</p>
