                    <h2>Update 2/5/2018</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have rebuilt <span class="project-name"></span> in C++ and Qt Creator, with certain optimizations. I believe overall, the time performance is much better with this iteration than the previous. Check it out on the github. Also, I have compiled a small <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="assets/files/monster-sudoku-report.pdf">report</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is an NxN sudoku generator and solver. This was made for an artificial intelligence course at UCI (COMPSCI 171). <span class="project-name"></span> can generate random puzzles of different sizes, and solve them. It can also accept puzzles from text files.</p>
        
                    <h2 id="use">Usage</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use <span class="project-name"></span>, you can either give it a text file containing a puzzle or generate a random puzzle instead. Once a puzzle is generated, the solver will attempt to solve the puzzle. If it finds a solution, it will display the completed puzzle. If not, then it will state that there is no solution.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> also keeps track of many different things. The most notable one is time elapsed. It keeps track of time for many different parts of the searching algorithm.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, <span class="project-name"></span> also has various heuristic flags that can be enabled. This will tell <span class="project-name"></span> to use that heuristic in the search algorithm. The heuristics are as follows:</p>
                    
                    <div class="multi-list">
                        <ul class="fade-li">
                            <li><span>Minimum remaining values (MRV)</span>: Determine which variable (or cell in this case) to try and solve next by looking at their domains. Variables with smaller domains are more likely to have the correct value chosen than ones with larger domains.</li>
                            <li><span>Least constraining value (LCV)</span>: Determine which value to assign to a variable by choosing the value that will affect the least number of constraints. A value that affects a smaller number of constraints is less likely to cause a failure.</li>
                            <li><span>Degrees heuristic (DH)</span>: Determine which variable to solve next by choosing the variable with the highest number of constraints to unassigned variables. This helps reduce as many domains as possible.</li>
                            <li><span>Arc consistency</span>: Ensure that impossible or illegal values are removed from variables before trying to solve another variable. This ensures consistency, and reduces the likelihood of choosing a failing value.</li>
                            <li><span>Forward checking</span>: Determine how a value assignment will affect the variable's neighbors before assigning it.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> was made in C++ using <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/">Qt Creator</a>. The solver uses <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking search</a> with the help of some heuristic algorithms to solve random puzzles. The solver will either find a solution for a given puzzle, determine that there is no solution, or time out.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Constraint Satisfaction Problem</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudoku puzzles can be modelled as <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">constraint satisfaction problems</a>, which are mathematical problems that have a set of constraints that need to be satisfied. This can be represented by a set of variables, each with a domain of possible values, and a set of rules or constraints relating the variables together. For a sudoku puzzle, the variables are each of the cells, the domains would be the numbers 1 - 9 (or higher for larger puzzles), and the constraints would be that each number must appear exactly once per row, column, and box.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Searching</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> uses backtracking search to solve puzzles. Essentially, it goes through every single cell, and assigns it a value. If at any time, <span class="project-name"></span> cannot assign a value to an empty cell, it backtracks. If the solver cannot backtrack anymore, it considers the puzzle unsolvable.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> uses the heuristics listed above (if enabled), to aid and speed up the search. Before choosing a cell to solve, the solver performs a check across each constraint to maintain <span>arc consistency</span>. Afterwards, the solver chooses a cell via the <span>DH</span> and <span>MRV</span> heuristics. Finally, it decides on a value for that cell via the <span>LCV</span> and <span>forward check</span> heuristics. If any of these heuristics are disabled, then it simply skips those steps. If none of these heuristics are enabled, then it simply chooses a random cell, and a random value for it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Backtracking</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <span class="project-name"></span> finds that it cannot assign a value to an unassigned cell, it backtracks. To do this, the solver keeps track in a bookkeeping data structure of each assignment and each domain reduction, and groups them by step. When the solver needs to backtrack, it simply undos the most recent step of actions. The solver knows when it can no longer backtrack by seeing that the bookkeeping is empty.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Time Keeping</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> also keeps track of time. It keeps track of time spent per heuristic, the total time, and bookkeeping time. This is used to analyze the heuristics, different combinations of heuristics, and the parameters for the puzzle.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is not exactly a strong solver. It has trouble solving 12+ size puzzles due to inefficient algorithms. A few optimizations can greatly speed up the searching process. The most notable one is the <span>degrees heuristic</span>. Currently, the solver only searches for the neighbors when it needs to. This means that at every step, it must calculate the neighbors of every single cell to determine which cell to choose. Instead, this can be pre-computed and stored in the data structure. Whenever a cell is assigned, that cell's neighbors will have their degrees modified.</p>
