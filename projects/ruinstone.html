                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is a 3D online fighting game that supports up to 4 players in a free-for-all. You play as a wizard with a selection of 4 chosen spells, and you fight other wizards in a battle arena until only one wizard remains.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> was also entered in a competition, the <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="http://occs.ieee.org/gamesig/">IEEE GameSIG 2017 Showcase</a>, and ended as a semi-finalist.</p>

                    <h3>Creating and Joining Games</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To play <span class="project-name"></span>, you either create a lobby for other players to join, or look for one yourself. You can do this from the main menu. When creating a lobby, you will see a new menu. Here, you can see the players currently in the lobby, and your spells. You can choose your spell loadout from here before the game starts. Joining an existing lobby will lead you to the same menu, but you will not be able to start the game yourself.</p>

                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is primarily a fighting game; thus, players fight each other until there is only one left. To do that, you must move your character around to dodge spells and reposition, and cast your own spells. To move your player, you right-click at a point on the ground you wish to move to. The character will automatically turn and move towards that point.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cast a spell, you press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to prime that spell, and then left-click at a point on the ground, or at another character. The spell will then be cast, and got on cooldown. Most spells require a target of some kind, but some are cast on yourself automatically.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are killed if you lose all of your health by taking damage from enemy spells. Once killed, you must wait a few seconds before respawning. If you lose all of your lives, you have lost the game.</p>

                            <li><span>Innervate</span>: You move much faster.</li>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> was made in C# with <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>. We used several outside assets, including <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://www.photonengine.com/en/PUN">Photon</a>, <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/36250">Magic Missiles</a>, and <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/25142">3 Skyboxes</a>. The player models, the arena, and the main menu were all created by Christian Sydow, and the music was made by Cyrus Fiete.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Player Character</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player character is made up of several scripts. There is a single controller that interacts with botht the UI and the character data. This controller allows the player to move around, cast spells, and take damage. The controller reads and updates the character data. This data contains all of the character's stats, like movement speed, health, and damage bonuses. The controller updates the character UI, by updating the health, and setting the cooldowns of his/her spells.</p>
                    
                    <div class="img-wrapper fade-img">
                        <img id="i6" src="../assets/images/ruinstone/ruinstone-i6.png">
                        <p class="caption">The character UI. Here you can see the health on the left, and the four spells.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player movement and casting is similar to a MOBA-like system, where the players move around by right-clicking, and cast spells by priming that spell and then left-clicking.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Spell System</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells are created by matching several different components together. Each spell needs the effect, and a delivery method. This delivery method can be in the form of a projectile, or by a status. Projectile spells transfer their effect logic onto the projectile, in the form of an on-hit method. Status spells directly affect their targets. Each spell has a data structure that contains that spells stats, and a controller which determines how the spell works. This controller will either directly execute its effect onto their target, or spawn a projectile and off-load the effect onto it.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the <span>Fireball</span> spell spawns a flaming projectile, which then damages the first enemy it hits. The <span>Meteor</span> spell spawns a flaming meteor high above the arena, which then falls towards the ground and explodes upon impact. The <span>Innervate</span> spell does not spawn any projectile. Instead, it tells the caster's controller to increase the character's movement speed.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many spells give temporary changes to a character's stats. This is handled by the character's controller. When a temporary effect of some kind targets a character, that effect is stored in the controller. At each tick, the controller checks the effects stored to see if any have expired. Upon expiration, the effect is reversed. Each effect has an effect and inverse-effect method for this purpose.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different spells also have different targeting methods. For example, the <span>Fireball</span> spell requires a target direction, but does not care about individual points. On the other hand, the <span>Meteor</span> spell requires a target point within range. The <span>Innervate</span> spell does not require a target, as the target is always the caster character.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Networking</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Networking was done by Photon. When players create or join a lobby, they do this via methods provided by Photon. In-game, whenever a player performs an action, such as move, or casting a spell, the player's client informs Photon, which then informs all of the other clients. This also occurs when a player takes damage, when a projectile moves or dissipates, and when a player dies.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is completed for now. There were many planned features prior to the creation of this game that are not present in this release. Among them were:</p>
                    
                    <div class="multi-list">
                        <ul class="fade-li">
                            <li><span>Spell creation</span>: Instead of spells, you have spell components. You mix and match components to create custom spells.</li>
                            <li><span>Collectible spell components</span>: At the end of each game, each player gets a random component. You can collect these components and create spells out of them. The rarer the component, the more unique and powerful their effects were.</li>
                            <li><span>More spell elements</span>: There are only three elements present in the release: fire, gravity, and lightning. There were more elements planned, like cold. Each element would have a theme and specialty, and every spell component would inherit that specialty.</li>
                            <li><span>More spell effects</span>: Currently, the effects of the spells are simplistic. They are either deal damage as a projectile, deal damage in an area, and buff or debuff a target. There were plans for summoning stationary objects that performed the effect, as opposed to a projectile, forcibly pushing and pulling enemies, and stuns and other crowd control effects.</li>
                        </ul>
