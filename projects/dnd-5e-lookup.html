                    <h3>Search Filters</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once set, you can also filter out certain subtypes. Different data types have different filters. For example, <span>Monsters</span> can be filtered by type, challenge rating, and size. <span>Spells</span> can be filtered by school, what classes can cast this, and level. <span>Items</span> can be filtered by type of item, weight, value, and rarity.</p>

                    <h3>Sorting Metrics</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also sort how the results are displayed. Just like the filters, different data types have different sorting metrics. Monsters can be sorted by name, challenge rating, type, size, tags, and source material. Spells, on the other hand, can be sorted by name, school, class, level, and source material.</p>

                    <h3>Results and Display</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the results come in from a search query, you can select any result to display it onto the display window. This will display all relevant information in an organized way. Monsters show their statistics, features, and actions. Spells  show their statistics, effect description, and classes. Items will show their statistics, and description.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is made in <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> and C#. The database is made in SQLite3 via <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://www.sqlitestudio.pl">SQLite Studio</a> and <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip">DataGrip</a>. However, the actual insertion of data into the database is done via C# scripts that send INSERT queries to the database. The user interface is made entirely with Unity assets, and the <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://www.dafont.com/dalelands.font">Dalelands</a> font. <span class="project-name"></span> is made with the <a class="pulse" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC pattern</a> in mind. The database acts as the data layer, while the several managers act as the controllers. Finally, the UI acts as the view. Custom data structures are also used to transport data between the three.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Database Management</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The database is managed by two database controller scripts made in C#. The first, called the <span>handler</span>, handles creating SELECT queries from the search parameters, and retrieves data from the database. The <span>handler</span> stores this data into custom data structures, which are then sent back. The second, called the <span>loader</span>, handles creating INSERT queries out of data from the Unity inspector. The insertion of data into the database is done via a custom C# script that lets me enter data through the inspector (this is much easier than manually entering the data in SQLite Studio, or manually making INSERT queries in DataGrip).</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Interface</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user interface is managed by a view controller called <span>UI manager</span>, and many separate behaviour scripts. The <span>search bar</span>, <span>search filters</span>, and <span>results list</span> views provide search parameter data to the view controller. The <span>UI manager</span> will then send that data over to the <span>handler</span>, and return with data structures containing search result data. Next, the <span>UI manager</span> will send certain data to the <span>results list</span> view for it to display. Finally, when you select one of the results in the <span>results list</span>, the <span>UI manager</span> will send the appropriate data structure to the <span>display</span> view.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Individual UI Components</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span>UI manager</span> is aided in its task by several UI components. Each of these have a small, but very specific job, and they handle specific parts of the UI. For example, the <span>filter control</span> handles the <span>search filters</span>, and communicate directly with the <span>UI mananger</span> when filters are changed. It simply checks whether each of its values are toggled or not, and sets flags when a change is made. For the non-select filters, the <span>range control</span> handles them. Similar to the <span>filter control</span>, this simply checks whether the values in their fields have been modified.</p>

                    <h3>Current Status</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="project-name"></span> is currently in development. This was made as a learning experience in C#, SQLite3, Unity3D, data management, and UI design. Since it is early in development, it only has a few features:</p>
                    
                    <div class="multi-list">
                        <ul class="fade-li">

                            <li><span>Data-dependent sort metrics</span>: Sort metrics available that change depending on the data type. Can choose ascending or descending.</li>

                    <h3>Planned Features</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many features and ideas planned for <span class="project-name"></span>. The most important one is refactoring and re-organizing the code. As this was meant to be a learning experience, the code is messy and unoptimized. This leads to difficulty when trying to add new data types, adding new data into the database, and creating the filters and sort metrics. The important features planned are:</p>
                    
                    <div class="multi-list">
                        <ul class="fade-li">
                            <li><span>All SRD content</span>: Include all SRD content.</li>
                            <li><span>More data types</span>: Include backgrounds, classes, conditions, features, items, races, spells, and more.</li>
                            <li><span>Caching</span>: Improve performance by caching query results. Change the cache for the real-time updates, instead of making new queries.</li>
                            <li><span>Better UI</span>: Improve UI elements and layout so that it is clearer and sharper.</li>
                            <li><span>Custom Data</span>: Include ability to make your content.</li>
                            <li><span>Character Creator</span>: Include ability to make a character.</li>
