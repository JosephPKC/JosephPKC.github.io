TODO:
- Beautify the pages. Add some backgrounds, images, flair, colors, etc. (But don't clutter; keep it clean)
- Create project html pages and place in projects folder.
- Fix responsive layouts, for mobile resolutions. 
- Add resume
- Add more to description in about
- Make the next (add the descriptor) project, the name of project, date, and techs (add this in) dynamic- use a js script to add these things to each project page from the json.

12. Reformatting notes: Use css grid to have responsive layouts instead.

- After doing the above, we can do a redesign of the website using CSS Grid + Flex. This should make life easier, and we can choose different color schemes and themes. (Maybe re-think the hover animations)
- We should do this AFTER finishing REV 2 of the website, so that when we do the redesign of REV 3, we already know what the content is going to be.

Ideas: 
-New color scheme, something a bit poppier, sharper, and stand-out-ish.
-New fonts, maybe something a bit more modern.
-New hover animations, less clunky and laggy (especially on mobile)
-Remove Contacts, and have Contacts at the footer/header of each page.
-Begin at the Projects page, and have a little intro (1-2 lines) at the top.
-Have objects and buttons pop out more, add better highlighting (other than just changing background color)
-For the projects, have more misc pictures to show at the end (like in a row)
-Add some GIFs of usage for each project.
-Have better looking buttons
-Collapse the nav bar into a dropdown
-Don't make things too big, like the nav bar, or buttons. Smaller is sometimes better.
-We can use JS to dynamically create stuff, relating to the projects, and other highly-mutable things.
-We can have a landing page, that is just buttons (no nav bar, or header). Completely separate from the other pages.
-Pick a strong theme. This should lend itself with the colors, fonts, layouts, and any backgrounds.
-Don't have too much dead space.
