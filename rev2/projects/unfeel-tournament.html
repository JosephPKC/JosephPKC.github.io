                    <h1>What is Unfeel Tournament?</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfeel Tournament is a 2D multiplayer fighting game. Players control one of four emotions, and must pick up weapons and items scattered throughout the level to defeat the others and be the last emotion standing. Check out the <a href="https://unfeeltournament.github.io/">game</a>.</p>

                    <h1>Development</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfeel Tournament was made for a game development course in UCI (COMP SCI 113). My team and I came up with this idea of emotions, Angry, Happy, Sad, Worried, fighting for control over a person's feelings. The last emotion standing would end up being the emotion that person feels. The emotions begin at a landscape, representing the natural world (and space), and utilize weapons scattered throughout to fight for control. The goal of this game, was to create a fast-paced, simple, and fun multiplayer experience. Unfeel Tournament was made in <a href="https://www.unity3d.com">Unity3D</a> and C#.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main menu includes a background that shows all four emotions. From the main menu, you can choose to play a game, look at the controls, or check out the team.</p>

                    <p class="caption">The main menu.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accommodate four player local multiplayer, we added Xbox 360 controller support. Two players would use the keyboard + mouse, and two others would use controllers (or extra keyboards).</p>

                    <img id="i2" src="../images/unfeel-tournament-i2.png">
                    <p class="caption">The controls.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you begin a game, you must first decide on the game settings: number of lives, number of players, and duration. Each player begins with the number of lives chosen, and once a player loses all of their lives, they are dead. The game ends when the game time has elapsed the duration chosen. Once the game ends by time, the player with the most kills is chosen as a winner. Otherwise, the game ends when there is only one player left alive, and that player is chosen as a winner.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the game settings are chose, each player takes turns choosing an emotion. Only one of each emotion can appear. Emotions have no impact on gameplay.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after the characters are selected, the level must be chosen. The game comes with 4 different levels- each with its own theme: Mountain, Graveyard, Snowy, Space.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players now enter the game, and can start playing. There are specific spawn points for items, and each spawn point has its own selection of items that can spawn. Certain items have a higher chance of spawning. Players pick up items, and use them. If it is a weapon, the player equips that weapon and replacing their previously wewapon. Otherwise, the player immediately gains the effects of that item for a short time.</p>
